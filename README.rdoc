== Description

Brainzmapper is simply a DataMapper-based wrapper around the MusicBrainz
database schema, making tables available as objects to Ruby.

The project is currently at the very start of development; the table coverage
is only about 12%. Furthermore, any element of the API may change at any time.

== License

The code is derived from the MusicBrainz database schema, and thus is licensed
under the same terms as the MusicBrainz server--the GNU General Public License
version 2.
