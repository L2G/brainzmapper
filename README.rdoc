== Description

Brainzmapper is simply a DataMapper-based wrapper around the MusicBrainz
database schema, making tables available as objects to Ruby.

The project is currently at the very start of development. Any element of the
API may change at any time.

== License

The code is derived from the MusicBrainz database schema, and thus is licensed
under the same terms as the MusicBrainz server--the GNU General Public License
version 2.
