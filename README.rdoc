== Description ==

dm-brainz is simply a DataMapper-based wrapper around the MusicBrainz database
schema, making tables available as objects to Ruby.

The project is currently at the very start of development. Nothing exciting to
see here yet.

The code is derived from the MusicBrainz database schema, and thus is licensed
under the same terms as the MusicBrainz server--the GNU General Public License
version 2.
